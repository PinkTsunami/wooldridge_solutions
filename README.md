# Introductory Econometrics by Jeffrey Wooldridge, Computer Solutions
R scripts for computer exercises in Introductory Econometrics by Jeffery Wooldridge (5/6 ed.)

This is not intended to be homework solutions to the exercises.
Because of this, you will not find solutions to problems that do not require a computer program/software to answer.
You will also not find any interpretation of the output produced by the code.

The intent of these scripts is to provide (only) the code required to answer most of the computer exercises found within the textbook.
Thus if you are looking for an introduction to coding econometrics within R, this may be a good resource.
